# Flexcan_Canfd_Demo
---

## Function Description

This example demonstrates the usage of FlexCAN in CAN FD mode and its self-test procedure:

- Short CAN1_H to CAN2_H and CAN1_L to CAN2_L on the board to perform self-test
- Nominal baud rate: 500Kbps, Data baud rate: 2000Kbps
- CAN1 uses Mailbox-1 to transmit CAN-FD frames with ID 0x002, and Mailbox-0 to receive CAN-FD frames with ID 0x003
- CAN2 uses Mailbox-1 to transmit CAN-FD frames with ID 0x003, and Mailbox-0 to receive CAN-FD frames with ID 0x002
- Both CAN1 and CAN2 print the content of received messages in real-time
- The self-test concludes after CAN1 transmits 10 messages
